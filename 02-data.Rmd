# Data sources

Eric is responsible for collecting the data. 

Fortunately, two datasets, related to Portuguese red and white Vinho Verde wine samples, are publicly available on UCI
Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

## Dataset Summary

### Number of Records
- `red wine`: 1599 examples

- `white wine`: 4898 examples

### Attributes and Outcome
In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset.

1. `fixed acidity`: non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid)
Fixed Acidity is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

2. `volatile acidity`: high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste
Volatile Acidity is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

3.  `citric acid`: increases wine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine
Citric Acid is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

4.  `residual sugar:`: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'. Residual Sugar is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

5.  `chlorides`: the amount of salt in wine
Chlorides is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

6.  `free sulfur dioxide`: prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
Free Sulfur Dioxide is expressed in $\frac{mg}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

7.  `total sulfur dioxide`: the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine
Total sulfur dioxide is expressed in $\frac{mg}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

8.  `density`: sweeter wines have a higher density
Density is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

9.  `pH`: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale.

10. `sulphates`: a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine
Sulphates is expressed in $\frac{g}{dm^{3}}$ in this dataset.

11. `alcohol`: Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV.
Alcohol is measured in % vol or alcohol by volume (ABV) in this dataset.

12. `quality`: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).

### Types of Variables 
11 attributes are all numeric and the outcome is integer.
