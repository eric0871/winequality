# Data sources

Eric is responsible for collecting the data. 

Fortunately, two datasets, related to Portuguese red and white Vinho Verde wine samples, are publicly available on UCI
Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

## Dataset Summary

### Number of Records
- `red wine`: 1599 examples

- `white wine`: 4898 examples

### Attributes and Outcome
In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset.

1. `fixed acidity`: non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid)

2. `volatile acidity`: high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste

3.  `citric acid`: increases wine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine

4.  `residual sugar:`: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'.

5.  `chlorides`: the amount of salt in wine

6.  `free sulfur dioxide`: prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7.  `total sulfur dioxide`: the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine

8.  `density`: sweeter wines have a higher density

9.  `pH`: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale.

10. `sulphates`: a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine

11. `alcohol`: Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV.

12. `quality`: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).

### Types of Variables 
11 attributes are all numeric and the outcome is integer.
