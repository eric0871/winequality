# Data transformation

As our datasets are well organized in csv files, we just call `read.csv` to load in wine data.
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

red_df <- read.csv("resource/winequality-red.csv", sep = ';', head = T)
head(red_df)
```

```{r}
summary(red_df)
```
