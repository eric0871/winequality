# Data transformation

## Load Data
As our datasets are well organized in csv files, we just call `read.csv(...)` to load in wine dataset. Observe that we do have 12 columns in total (11 attributes and 1 outcome). 
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

df <- read.csv("resource/winequality-red.csv", sep = ';', head = T)
head(df)
```
## Data Statistics
Now let's get some metrics about the attributes and outcome.
```{r}
summary(df)
```

## Categorize `quality` column
Here, we cut `quality` to three factor levels as follows and store it as `quality.category` back to the dataframe: 

- `poor`: `quality` <  5

- `average`: `quality` = 5 or 6 

- `good`: `quality` > 6

```{r}
df$quality.category <- cut(df$quality,breaks=c(2,4,6,9),labels = c('poor','average','good'))
head(df)
```
