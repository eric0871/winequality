As lots of people get the festivities started with a great glass of wine, we are excited to provide a brief introduction on the quality of Vinho Verde red and white wines from the north of Portugal. In our report, our goal is to identify the relationship between red/white quality and eleven physicochemical attributes. Note that, due to privacy and logistic issues, we have no access to wine brands, selling price, etc. For more information, see the reference [Cortez et al., 2009] http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/. In this project, we plan to answer the questions as follows: What's the distribution of each attribute? Is it normally distrtibuted or skewed? Are there any attribute pairs have a linear correlation? What's the top 3 attributes that has the highest positive/negative correlation with red/white wine quality?

Fortunately, two datasets, related to Portuguese red and white Vinho Verde wine samples, are publicly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. 2.1 Dataset Summary 2.1.1 Number of Records red wine: 1599 examples white wine: 4898 examples 2.1.2 Attributes and Outcome In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset. fixed acidity: non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid) volatile acidity: high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste citric acid: increases swine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine residual sugar:: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'. chlorides: the amount of salt in wine free sulfur dioxide: prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine total sulfur dioxide: the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine density: sweeter wines have a higher density pH: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale. sulphates: a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine alcohol: Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV. quality: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). 2.1.3 Types of Variables 11 attributes are all numeric and the outcome is integer.
