As lots of people get the festivities started with a great glass of wine, we hope to provide readers with some takeaways on how to pick a wine that matches their taste preference most by analyzing the indicators of the quality of red wine. In our report, we conduct an exploratory data analysis on the quality of Portugues Vinho Verde red wine. Our goal is to identify the relationship between red wine quality and eleven physicochemical attributes. Credit: Marketview Liquor In this project, we plan to answer the questions as follows: Does only the sweetness or sourness affect the quality of wine the most? If not, which would be the attribute that affects the red wine quality the most? What's the distribution of each attribute? Are there many outliers in each attribute? Are there any attribute pairs have a linear correlation? How about multi-linear correlation between quality and the combination of attributes?

Fortunately, the dataset, related to Portuguese red Vinho Verde wine samples, is publicly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. Notice that, due to privacy and logistic issues, we have no access to wine brands, selling price, etc. For more information, see the reference [Cortez et al., 2009] http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/. 2.1 Attributes and Outcome In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset. fixed acidity \\((g/l)\\): non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid) volatile acidity \\((g/l)\\): high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste citric acid \\((g/l)\\): increases wine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine residual sugar \\((g/l)\\): the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'. chlorides \\((g/l)\\): the amount of salt in wine free sulfur dioxide \\((mg/l)\\): prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine total sulfur dioxide \\((mg/l)\\): the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine density \\((g/cm^{3})\\): sweeter wines have a higher density pH: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale. sulphates \\((g/l)\\): a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine alcohol \\((vol.\\%)\\): Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV. quality: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). 2.2 Number of Records red wine: 1599 examples 2.3 Types of Variables All the attributes are numeric and the outcome is integer.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and Outliers 5.2 Pairwise Attribute Correlation 5.3 Correlation between Quality and Attributes 5.4 Pair Attributes v.s. Quality 5.5 Parallel Coordinate Plot", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and Outliers 5.1.1 Histogram for Attributes From the histogram, there are several things we observed: Volatile acidity, density, and pH seem to be normally distributed. Alcohol level, fixed acidity, free sulfur dioxide, sulphates, and total sulfur dioxide are right skewed. Chlorides and residual sugar have relatively low variance. Citric acid seems to have a plateau-shaped distribution. Most wine has the quality of 5 and 6. 5.1.2 Boxplot for Attributes From the boxplot, there are several things we observed: All the attributes have quite many outliers except citric.acid and alcohol. The median of our dependent variable - quality is 6. 5.2 Pairwise Attribute Correlation 5.2.1 Scatterplot Matrix From the scattorplot matrix, we can observe that the following pairwise variables seem to have a linear correlation: strong positive correlation: fixed acidity/citric acid, fixed acidity/density strong negative correlation: fixed acidity/pH, density/alcohol 5.2.2 Correlation Heatmap From the correlation heatmap, we again confirm the conclusion above Three attributes fixed acidity, citric acid and density are closely positively correlated. Fixed acidity/pH, density/alcohol have high negative correlation. The observation is consistent with one of our conjectures: **Sweeter red wine implies higher density and lower pH. P.S. For further analysis or feature selection, we could cluster all these attributes into one group. 5.3 Correlation between Quality and Attributes Recall the correlation heatmap, we can also tell attributes such as alcohol, citric acid and volatile acidity seem to have a linear correlation with quality. 5.3.1 Sweetness and Sourness v.s. Quality When rookies first drink red wine, it's much easier to taste the level of sweetness and acidity. This common sense is consistent with our scatterplot for residual sugar and volatile acidity versus quality. Residual Sugar vs Quality We can see that only red wines with quality on or below average have high and middle residual sugar, while red wines with good quality only have low residual sugar. So, if the red wine you taste is very sweet , the quality of the red wine you drink is probably on or below average. Volatile acidity vs Quality Observe that only red wines with quality on or below average has high volatile acidity. So, if you taste the red wine is very sour, the quality red wine you drink is probably on or below average. However, we have to keep in mind that the scattorplot above doesn't generate any linear correlation between quality and sweetness/sourness. Now, from the boxplot above, we observe that there seems to be no linear correlation between quality and residual sugar. On the contrary, quality and volatile acidity seems to be negatively correlated. That is, the lower volatile acidity implies the better quality. 5.3.2 Alcohol v.s. Quality Alcohol has the strongest positive correlation with quality in our dataset. And from this graph, we can clearly see this relationship. Better wines have a high alcohol percentage. It is either because strong wines are more tasty or people who rates wines are wine lovers and they favor strong wines. 5.4 Pair Attributes v.s. Quality Then, let's study how the combination of two variables affects quality by looking at some multivariate graphs. 5.4.1 Alcohol + Volatile Acidity From the graph above, wee can see that good wines have higher alcohol and low volatile acidity levels than the other two groups with some outliers. The wine with the highest alcohol level scored only a 5 in quality. Also, the poor wines seem to have a dispersed distribution suggesting that people are consistent in the standards of good wines but inconsistent in the standards of poor wines. 5.4.2 Alcohol + Chlorides This graph is interesting because it shows that most wines that have high chlorides level are categorized as average wines. This pattern suggests that chlorides may have a non-linear relationship with quality. 5.4.3 Volatile Acidity + Chlorides This graph supports our theory before that people have consistent standards of good wine and inconsistent standards of poor wines. Because all good wines are clustered in the lower left corner of the graph and poor wines have dispersed distribution. 5.5 Parallel Coordinate Plot In this parallel coordinate plot, we group by quality into two category: poor (0-5) and good (5-10). From the above parallel coordinate plot, it can further validate our correlation relationships between different variables. It can also indicates which factor leads to good taste for the red wine.
