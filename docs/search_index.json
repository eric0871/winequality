As lots of people get the festivities started with a great glass of wine, we are excited to provide a brief introduction on the quality of Vinho Verde red and white wines from the north of Portugal. In our report, our goal is to identify the relationship between red/white quality and eleven physicochemical attributes. Note that, due to privacy and logistic issues, we have no access to wine brands, selling price, etc. For more information, see the reference [Cortez et al., 2009] http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/. In this project, we plan to answer the questions as follows: What's the distribution of each attribute? Is it normally distrtibuted or skewed? Are there any attribute pairs have a linear correlation? What's the top 3 attributes that has the highest positive/negative correlation with red/white wine quality?

Fortunately, two datasets, related to Portuguese red and white Vinho Verde wine samples, are publicly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. 2.1 Dataset Summary 2.1.1 Number of Records red wine: 1599 examples white wine: 4898 examples 2.1.2 Attributes and Outcome In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset. fixed acidity: non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid) volatile acidity: high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste citric acid: increases wine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine residual sugar:: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'. chlorides: the amount of salt in wine free sulfur dioxide: prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine total sulfur dioxide: the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine density: sweeter wines have a higher density pH: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale. sulphates: a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine alcohol: Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV. quality: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). 2.1.3 Types of Variables 11 attributes are all numeric and the outcome is integer.

From the histogram, there are several things we observed: 1. Density, pH, volatile acidity are normally distributed. 2. Chlorides and residual sugar have low variance. 3. Alcohol level, fixed acidity, free sulfur dioxide, sulphates, and total sulfur dioxide are right skewed. 4. Citric acid has a plateau distribution. 5. Most wine has quality of 5 and 6. From the boxplots, we have the following observations: 1. Every variable has outliers. 2. The median of our dependent variable - quality is 6. In order to discover the relationships between each variable, let's show the heatmap of correlation matrices. From the heatmap, the variables that have high correlation with quality are alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, citric acid, and Next, let's take a look at some bavariate graphs of these variables. Alcohol has the strongest correlation with quality in our dataset. And from this graph, we can clearly see this relationship. Better wines have a high alcohol percentage. It is either because strong wines are more tasty or people who rates wines are wine lovers and they favor strong wines. From the graph above, we can tell that volatile acidity has a negative relationship with quality. Better wines tend to have lower median of volatile acidity. Sulphates seems to have positive relationship with quality. Better wines have higher median of sulphates level. Citric acid seems to have positive relationship with quality. Better wines have higher median of citric acid level. Then, let's study how the combination of two variables affect quality by looking at some multivariate graphs. From the graph above, wee can see that good wines have higher alcohol and low volatile acidity levels than the other two groups with some outliers. The wine with the highest alcohol level scored only a 5 in quality. Also, the poor wines seem to have a dispersed distribution suggesting that people are consistent in the standards of good wines but inconsistent in the standards of poor wines. This graph is interesting because it shows that most wines that have high chlorides level are categorized as average wines. This pattern suggests that chlorides may have a non-linear relationship with quality. This graph supports our theory before that people have consistent standards of good wine and inconsistent standards of poor wines. Because all good wines are clustered in the lower left corner of the graph and poor wines have dispersed distribution.
