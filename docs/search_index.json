As lots of people get the festivities started with a great glass of wine, we hope to provide readers with some takeaways on how to pick a wine that matches their taste preference most by analyzing the indicators of the quality of red wine. In our report, we conduct an exploratory data analysis on the quality of Portugues Vinho Verde red wine. Our goal is to identify the relationship between red wine quality and eleven physicochemical attributes. Credit: Marketview Liquor In this project, we plan to answer the questions as follows: Does only sweetness or sourness affect the quality of wine the most? If not, which would be the attribute that affects the red wine quality the most? What's the distribution of each attribute? Are there many outliers in each attribute? Are there any attribute pairs have a linear correlation? How about multi-linear correlation between quality and the combination of attributes?

Fortunately, the dataset, related to Portuguese red Vinho Verde wine samples, is publicly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. Notice that, due to privacy and logistic issues, we have no access to wine brands, selling price, etc. For more information, see the reference [Cortez et al., 2009] http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/. 2.1 Attributes and outcome In total, we have 11 attributes and 1 outcome (quality) for wine dataset. fixed acidity \\((g/l)\\): non-volatile acid that do not evaporate readily (e.g. tartaric acid) volatile acidity \\((g/l)\\): high acetic acid in wine that leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste citric acid \\((g/l)\\): increases wine acidity and adds a fresh flavor to wine residual sugar \\((g/l)\\): the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. Note that more than 45 g/l is a 'sweet wine'. chlorides \\((g/l)\\): the amount of salt in wine free sulfur dioxide \\((mg/l)\\): prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine total sulfur dioxide \\((mg/l)\\): the portion of free SO2 plus the portion bound to other chemicals in wine density \\((g/cm^{3})\\): sweeter wines have a higher density pH: the level of acidity on a scale of 0â€“14. Most wines range from 3 to 4 on the pH scale. sulphates \\((g/l)\\): a food preservative to maintain the flavor and freshness of wine alcohol \\((vol.\\%)\\): Note that the alcohol content of wine is between 5% and 23% ABV. quality: a grading scale of wine quality that ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). 2.2 Number of records red wine: 1599 examples 2.3 Types of variables All the attributes are numeric and the outcome is integer.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and outliers 5.2 Pairwise attribute correlation 5.3 Correlation between quality and attributes 5.4 Pairwise attributes v.s. Quality 5.5 Parallel coordinate plot for quality", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Distribution and outliers 5.1.1 Histogram for attributes From the histogram, there are several things we observed: Volatile acidity, density, and pH seem to be normally distributed. Alcohol level, fixed acidity, free sulfur dioxide, sulphates, and total sulfur dioxide are right skewed. Chlorides and residual sugar have relatively low variance. Citric acid seems to have a plateau-shaped distribution. Most wine has the quality of 5 and 6. 5.1.2 Boxplot for attributes From the boxplot, there are several things we observed: All the attributes have quite many outliers except citric.acid and alcohol. As less outliers might implies better distribution of the attribute data, we should keep an eye on those two columns with few outliers. The median of our dependent variable - quality is 6. 5.2 Pairwise attribute correlation 5.2.1 Scatterplot matrix From the scattorplot matrix, we can observe that the following pairwise variables seem to have a linear correlation: strong positive correlation: fixed acidity/citric acid, fixed acidity/density strong negative correlation: fixed acidity/pH, density/alcohol 5.2.2 Correlation heatmap From the correlation heatmap, we again confirm the conclusion above Three attributes fixed acidity, citric acid and density are closely positively correlated. Fixed acidity/pH, density/alcohol have high negative correlation. The observation is consistent with one of our conjectures: Sweeter red wine implies higher density and lower pH. p.s. For further analysis or feature selection, we could cluster all these attributes into one group. 5.3 Correlation between quality and attributes Recall the correlation heatmap, we can also tell attributes such as alcohol, citric acid and volatile acidity seem to have a linear correlation with quality. 5.3.1 Sweetness/sourness v.s. Quality When rookies first drink red wine, it's much easier to taste the level of sweetness and acidity. This common sense is consistent with our scatterplot for residual sugar and volatile acidity versus quality. Residual sugar vs Quality We can see that only red wines with quality on or below average have high and middle residual sugar, while red wines with good quality only have low residual sugar. So, we guess if the red wine you taste is very sweet , the quality of the red wine you drink is probably on or below average. Volatile acidity vs Quality Observe that only red wines with quality on or below average has high pH. So, we carry out a conjecture that if you taste the red wine is very sour, the quality red wine you drink is probably on or below average. However, we have to keep in mind that the scattorplot above doesn't generate any linear correlation between quality and sweetness or sourness. Now, from the boxplot above, we observe that neithe quality/residual sugar nor quality/pH have a linear correlation. That is, the sweetness or sourness is probably not the key attribute that affects the red wine quality most. This surprising observation does make sense, according to an article from Wine Enthusiast, the acidity and pH correlates to &quot;how our mouth work&quot; instead of the red wine quality per se. https://www.winemag.com/2019/06/19/what-is-acidity-in-wine/ 5.3.2 Alcohol v.s. Quality Now we shift the focus to another common and important attribute: alcohol. Alcohol has the strongest positive correlation with quality in our dataset. And from this graph, we can clearly see this relationship. Better wines have a high alcohol percentage. It is either because strong wines are more tasty or people who rates wines are wine lovers and they favor strong wines. 5.4 Pairwise attributes v.s. Quality Then, let's study how the combination of two variables affects quality by looking at some multivariate graphs. 5.4.1 Alcohol + Volatile acidity From the graph above, wee can see that good wines have higher alcohol and low volatile acidity levels than the other two groups with some outliers. The wine with the highest alcohol level scored only a 5 in quality. Also, the poor wines seem to have a dispersed distribution suggesting that people are consistent in the standards of good wines but inconsistent in the standards of poor wines. 5.4.2 Alcohol + Chlorides This graph is interesting because it shows that most wines that have high chlorides level are categorized as average wines. This pattern suggests that chlorides may have a non-linear relationship with quality. 5.4.3 Volatile Acidity + Chlorides This graph supports our theory before that people have consistent standards of good wine and inconsistent standards of poor wines. Because all good wines are clustered in the lower left corner of the graph and poor wines have dispersed distribution. 5.5 Parallel coordinate plot for quality We factorize quality into two category: poor (0-5) and good (5-10) for a better visualization. In this parallel coordinate plot, though the quality cluster is not very distinct, we can still observe some linear relations between different attributes: positive trend between sulphates ans alcohol and, the alcohol of good wine is higher than the one of the poor cluster. negative trend between fixed acidity and volatile acidity and most good wines have lower volatile acidity than the poor ones.

Over 80% of red wine in the data set are rated a 5 or 6 in quality score (average wines), 4% are rated 3 or 4 (poor wines), and 14% are rated 7 or 8 (good wines). There are some highly correlated variables in our dataset such as density/fixed acidity, fixed acidity/pH etc. We should consider dropping some of the variables if we are going to further study this dataset with machine learning methods. For instance, density is a variable that depends on other elements in a bottle of wine so it wouldnâ€™t provide us much new information thus should be dropped. 7.2 Sepculations Alcohol level has the greatest correlation with wine quality suggesting that people prefer heavy-bodied wines. Red wines with high chlorides are mostly categorized as average wines. This suggests a non-linear relationship between chlorides concentration and wine quality. We may be able to capture this relationship by methods like decision tree in further studies. The multivariate scatter plots we had for good and average wines in section 5.4 show clustering patterns whereas the scatter plots for poor wines exhibit a messier pattern. One reason to explain this is peopleâ€™s standards for good wines are uniform. The other reason which might explain this is that the wine tasters are stubborn to accept wines that tastes differently. Volatile acidity shows a negative relationship with quality whereas pH value doesnâ€™t show any visible relationship with quality. This observation suggests that people are indifferent about the sourness but they like the smoother and rounder taste of a low-acid wine. However, high-acid wine helps during aging so this might be a trade-off. "]]
